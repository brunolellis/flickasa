-= INTRODUCTION =-

With over 23,000 pictures on my Flickr account, feeling a little uncertain about the future of Flickr with Yahoo! closing projects left and right I tried several options to export my flickr pictures.

Enter Google+ and Picasa, a far more interesting combination to store my pictures for free than Facebook limited mainstream approach I needed a script to migrate my 23,589 pictures from Flickr to Picasa.

A friend recommended me a python script shown on a blog post at http://www.edparsons.com/2011/06/migrating-from-flickr-to-picasaweb/

This is slightly modified version of this script, it handles some exceptions that were probably not ocurring at the time the original author wrote it, and it managed to export all my 23,589 pictures (without breaking to an Exception during the entire run)

-= REQUIREMENTS =-

Python 2.6 recommended.

Requires flickrapi and gdata. You can installe these by issuing the following commands.

$ easy_install-2.6 gdata
$ easy_install-2.6 flickrapi
$ easy_install-2.6 threadpool

You will need a Flickr API Key and Secret to get the script to work.
You can obtain these at http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/noncommercial/

-= CONFIGURATION =-

Open flickasa.py, go to line 120 and start configuring your Picasa and Flickr Account Credentials.

-= RUNNING =-

After you've configured your credentials, just fire up the script on your terminal

$ python flickasa.py

If for some weird reason the script stops, just launch it again, it will re-scan your flickr account but it will only start uploading the pictures it hasn't already uploaded.

-= LICENSE =-

Do whatever you want with it, the original script didn't come with a license, so I'm not attaching a license to it either.
